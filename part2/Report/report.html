    <h1><u>Part 2</u></h1>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      For any Yelp review other users can give that review votes in any
      of three categories: "funny", "useful" and "cool"
      We wanted to determine whether there was a correlation between the
      sentiment of a review and the votes that review received from other
      users.
    </p>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      We predict that an increase in sentiment will result in a reduced number
      of funny votes, an increase in sentiment will result in a reduced number
      of useful votes and a decrease in sentiment will result in a increased
      number of cool votes.
    </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <h3>Data Extraction</h3>
    <p>
      We began our analysis by first extracting the relevant data from the Yelp
      academic dataset. We used a python script (part2.py) which iterated
      through the json objects in the provided dataset file
      (yelp_academic_dataset_review.json), extracting the text, date,
      "funny" votes, "useful" votes, and "cool" votes. In order to account
      for reviews that had been posted for longer being more likely to receive
      more votes in general, we attempted to normalize the vote counts by
      multiplying each vote count by 2016-year/2016-2004, where year is the
      year the review was published, 2016 is an end year which allows for
      reviews posted in 2015 and 2004 is Yelp's founding date. We saved
      the sentiment of the review (discussed below), the raw vote counts
      for each category, and the normalized vote counts for each category
      in a csv file named "out.csv".
    </p>
    <h3>Sentiment</h3>
    <p>
      Sentiment analysis involved two separate steps: tokenization and analysis.
    </p>
    <h4>Tokenization</h4>
    <p>
      Tokenization was done via a python function tokenizer (in tokenizer.py).
      All words had newline characters replaced with spaces and all punctutation
      removed completely. Any words designated as "stop words" by the python
      library nltk were removed completely from the given text and the stem
      of the remaining words was extracted via the porter stemmer algorithm
      (implemented in the accompanying python file). If there were any letters
      that were repeated 3 times or more in a row, then those letters were
      reduced to a single letter. If a word was less than 3 characters or greater
      than 20 characters after the resulting processing, then that word was
      ignored.
    </p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      The sentiment of a given text was determined by summing th sentiment score
      of all words in the tokenized text and was then normalized to a score
      between -1 (most negative) and 1 (most positive). The sentiment score
      of any individual word was determined by using the Technical University
      of Denmark's AFINN-111 score file (which had it's keys tokenized using
      the previously described algorithm).
    </p>
    <h3>Regression</h3>
    <p>
      After accumulating the data, we iterated through each vote count and
      attempted a linear regression (via sci-kit learn's
      linear_model.linear_regression function, which does regression
      via Ordinary Least Squares) on each. The resulting line and data were
      printed to a graph using matplotlib. Various other regression techniques
      were attempted (discussed below)
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    After initial attempts at linear regression it was determined that for
    each vote count, sentiment pair there was a mass of points that
    surrounded the origin, making attempts at regression nie impossible.
    This is because any attempt at fitting a line/curve to the full dataset
    would naturally be pulled down so far toward the origin that the regression
    would not trully fit the curves present in the data. Thus it was determined
    that there was no correlation between sentiment and vote counts for the Yelp
    dataset.
